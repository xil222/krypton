4 Incremental Inference Optimizations

4.1 Incremental computation for 1 layer
	-> Coordinate computation
	-> Putting it all together

4.2 Propagation across layers
	-> Sequence of layers
	-> Extensions to DAG of layers

4.3 Theoretical Speedups

4.4 Multi-query inference
	-> Reuse materialized features across layers
	-> High throughput GPU kernel
